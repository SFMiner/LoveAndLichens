Welcome to the Enchanted Forest Research Station

Dr. Oakhart: Greetings, young scientist! Welcome to our Enchanted Forest Research Station. I'm Dr. Oakhart, the lead botanist here. (do.GameState.print("Player met Dr. Oakhart"))

Player: It's great to be here, Dr. Oakhart! This forest looks magical.

Dr. Oakhart: Indeed it is! We study the unique flora and fauna of this mystical ecosystem. What brings you to our humble station?
- I'm here to study the magical plants.
- I'm interested in the enchanted creatures. (do.GameState.print("Player expressed interest in creatures"))
- I'm just exploring. Is it okay if I look around?

Dr. Oakhart: Before you go, I must ask: do you have any experience with magical ecosystems?
- Yes, I've studied them before.
	Dr. Oakhart: Wonderful! You'll find plenty of familiar concepts here, along with some surprises.
- No, this is my first time. (do.GameState.print("Player is new to magical ecosystems"))
	Dr. Oakhart: Not to worry! We all start somewhere. I'll make sure you receive proper guidance.

Dr. Oakhart: One last thing: we have a strict "Leave No Trace" policy here. The forest is delicate and magical. Promise you'll respect it?
- I promise to be careful and respectful.
	Dr. Oakhart: Excellent! You'll fit right in here.
- Can't I take just one small souvenir? (if GameState.is_true("is_new_to_magic"))
	Dr. Oakhart: I understand the temptation, but even small actions can have big consequences in a magical ecosystem. Let's focus on observing and learning instead.

Dr. Oakhart: Now, let me show you around our research station. (if GameState.is_true("has_safety_gear"))
	Dr. Oakhart: Great, I see you've already got your safety gear. We can head straight to the advanced research areas.
- I'm ready to see everything!
- Can we start with the basics first?

Enjoy your time here at the Enchanted Forest Research Station!
